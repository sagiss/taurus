.. currentmodule:: taurus.core.evaluation

Evaluation extension for taurus core model.

The evaluation extension is a special extension that provides evaluation
objects. The official scheme name is 'eval'.

The main usage for this extension is to provide a way of performing mathematical
evaluations with data from other source, as well as allowing fast interfacing
with sources of data not supported by specific schemes.

The Evaluation Factory (:class:`EvaluationFactory`) uses the following object
naming for referring to attributes (:class:`EvaluationAttribute`):

    `eval:[//<authority>][@<evaluator>/][<subst>;]<expr>`

or the following for referring to evaluation devices
(:class:`EvaluationDevice`):

    `eval:[//<authority>]@<evaluator>`

or the following for referring to an evaluation authority
(:class:`EvaluationAuthority`):

    `eval://<authority>`

where:

    - The `<authority>` segment is optional (except when referring to an
      EvaluationDatabase). At this point, only `//localhost` is supported.

    - The `@<evaluator>` is optional (except when referring to an
      EvaluationDevice). If not given, it defaults to `DefaultEvaluator`. See
      below for further details

    - `<expr>` is a mathematical expression (using python syntax)
      that may have references to other taurus **attributes** by enclosing them
      between `{` and `}`. Expressions will be evaluated by the evaluator device
      to which the attribute is assigned.

    - The optional `<subst>` segment is used to provide substitution symbols.
      `<subst>` is a semicolon-separated string of `<key>=<value>` strings.

The evaluator device inherits from :class:`SafeEvaluator` which by default
includes a large subset of mathematical functions from the :mod:`numpy`
module. If access to other symbols are required, a custom evaluator can
be used. `<evaluator>` is a unique identification name for the evaluator
device object and may define a source of additional symbols to be present
for the evaluation. The supported syntax for `@<evaluator>` is:

    - `@<ID>` (cannot contain dots or any of `/` `?` `#` `:` `=`). This
      indicates just an alternative name for the EvaluationDevice, It does not
      add any extra symbol to the evaluation context.

    - `@<modulename>.*` (<modulename> may include dots for submodules). It
      will make all symbols found in the given module available during the
      evaluation (i.e., it emulates doing `from <modulename> import *` in the
      evaluation context).

    - `@<modulename>.<customdeviceclass>`. Use your own custom EvaluationDevice
      based class. This allows to define custom symbols see
      :file:`<taurus>/core/evaluation/test/res/dev_example.py`, **but** note
      that this syntax is is now superseded by the "instance-based" one
      (see below), which is easier to use and provides write attribute support.

    - `@<inst>=<modulename>.<class>()` (e.g. `@c=mymod.MyClass()` ). This
      will import a class from a module, then instantiate it and then
      make the instance available for evaluation with the given name. Note that
      the `<inst>=` part may be omitted, in which case the instance will be
      available for evaluation as `self`. **IMPORTANT:** If the given class
      declares writable properties, EvaluationAttributes that access one such
      property will automatically be considered writable. See examples of usage
      in :file:`<taurus>/core/evaluation/test/res/mymod.py` and in
      :file:`<taurus>/core/evaluation/test/res/ipap_example.py`


Some examples of valid evaluation models are:

    - An attribute that multiplies a tango attribute by 2:

        `eval:2*{tango:a/b/c/d}`

    - Same as above, but using substitutions:

        `eval:k=2;a={tango:a/b/c/d};k*a`

    - An attribute that adds two tango attributes together (assuming that tango
      is set as the default scheme)

        `eval:{a/b/c/d}+{f/g/h/i}`

    - An attribute that generates an array of random values:

        `eval:rand(256)`

    - Same as above, but with units:

        `eval:Q(rand(256),'V')`

    - An attribute that adds noise to a tango image attribute:

        `eval:img={tango:sys/tg_test/1/short_image_ro};img+10*rand(*img.shape)`

    - An attribute that accesses a method from a given module (in this
      case to use os.path.exists):

        `eval:@os.*/path.exists("/some/file")`

    - Same as before, for getting today's date as an attribute:

        'eval:@datetime.*/date.today().isoformat()'

    - A default evaluator device named `foo`:

        `eval:@foo`

    - A custom evaluator device (implemented as class `MyEvalDev` in the `mymod`
      module):

        `eval:@mymod.MyEvalDev`

    - A custom evaluator device (implemented as class `MyEvalDev` in the `mymod`
      module):

        `eval:@mymod.MyEvalDev`

    - A writable attribute foo (implemented as a writable property of the
      `MyClass` class from the `mymod` module):

        `eval:@c=mymod.MyClass()/c.foo`

        assuming that the `mymod` module defines `MyClass` as:

            class MyClass(object):
                (...)
                get_foo(self):
                    (...)
                set_foo(self, value):
                    (...)
                foo = property(get_foo, set_foo)
                (...)





.. note:: Previous to SEP3, a RFC3986 non-compliant syntax was used for the
          evaluation scheme (e.g., allowing names such as
          ``tango://db=foo;dev=bar;a*b?k=2;a={tango:a/b/c/d}``).
          This syntax is now deprecated and should not be used. Taurus will
          issue warnings if detected.
